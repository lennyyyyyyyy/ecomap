## Functionality:
An application to predict urban heat island temperature fluctuations based on vegetation, population density, hydrology, and more, using a Tensorflow CNN, using data from the US Census Bureau, NASA Earth Observatory, and satellite GIS to curate accurate training data for the city of New York.

## Potential Impact:
EcoMap has the potential to revolutionize urban planning and environmental education by providing a hands-on tool for exploring the impacts of different environmental factors on urban temperatures. It can serve as a valuable resource for city planners, environmentalists, educators, and citizens, promoting informed decision-making and fostering a deeper understanding of sustainable urban development.

## Running the Application:
To run the application Tkinter and Python is required on your system. All other packages are on the virtual environment. Simply run `application.py`
